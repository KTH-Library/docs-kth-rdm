## About Collaboration and Sharing

KTH Data Repository's collaboration and sharing features allow you to share individual records/drafts with other users and communities.

From a high-level perspective, KTH Data Repository's features allow you to:

- Share individual records and drafts with specific users via links, as well as allow guests/users to request access.
- Share collections of records via communities.

### Individual Records/Drafts

Individual records/drafts can be shared in different ways depending on whom and how you want to share:

- **User sharing** – Enables you to share records/drafts with other KTH Data Repository users.
- **Link sharing** – Enables you to create a secret link that provides access to your record (e.g., with persons who do not have a KTH Data Repository account).
- **Access requests** – Allows guests/users to request access to a restricted/embargoed record.

### Permissions

The table below provides an overview of which permissions can be granted for the different types of sharing:

|  |  | User sharing | Link sharing | Access requests |

### Collection of Records

The communities feature allows you to organise a collection of records and share the collection with members of the community, who can be granted different roles as part of the community (see [About Communities](../communities/about_communities.md)).

This section focuses on how you submit drafts/records to a community and how you manage your submissions, regardless of whether you are a member or not:

- **Submit for review** – Learn how to submit a draft (unpublished record) to a community.
