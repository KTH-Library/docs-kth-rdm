Link sharing enables you to create a secret link which provides access to your record. The link can also have an expiry date. If the person you want to share a record with already has a KTH Data Repository account, you can also use user sharing.

### Permissions

You can give the secret link one of the following three permissions:

- **Can view**: Grants access to view restricted/embargoed files of all current and future versions of a published record.
- **Can preview draft**: Grants access to view drafts (unpublished records) and restricted/embargoed files of all current and future versions of a record/draft.
- **Can edit**: Grants access to edit drafts and view restricted/embargoed files of all current and future versions of a record.

*Note: The permissions apply to all current and future versions of a record/draft.*
