Access requests enable other users and guests to request access to view restricted files in your published record (e.g. anonymised clinical trial data that can only be shared with medical professionals).

## Request access

Users and guests can request access to restricted files in your record. As the record owner, you will receive a notification and can choose to approve or deny the request.

### Allow access requests

You can enable access requests for your restricted files. When enabled, users will see an option to request access, and you will be notified when a request is made.


## Request access

The following sections explain how to request access to restricted files in a record. The owner of the record can choose who is able to request access (one or both of):

- **Guests** – will be granted access via a secret link that expires after a duration defined by the owner.
- **Users** – will be granted permanent access via their user account (until revoked by the owner).
