## Change profile visibility

Your profile visibility controls who can find you on the KTH Data Repository. You can set the visibility of the following:

- **Profile**: Public profiles can be found by other users via searches using your username, full name, or affiliation. Hidden profiles cannot be found by other users.
- **Email**: Making your email public allows your profile to be discoverable via your email address.

By default, your email visibility is set to **hidden** when you create an account, for privacy reasons.

### Change your profile visibility

1. Click the **Profile** menu in the header and select **Profile**.
