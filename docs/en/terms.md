## General conditions

KTH Data Repository is a service for documenting and sharing data collected in research projects in which KTH is the principal research organisation. Here, KTH's employees, students and external partners can share, document, and control access to different types of data with version control. External parties can use the service only in cases where the party's use is in accordance with a collaborative research agreement where KTH is the coordinating party. All systems and services provided by KTH must be used in accordance with current Swedish regulations. This means that guidelines, rules and laws must be followed for the data that is stored and made available via KTH Data repository.

If a user does not comply with guidelines and the regulatory framework, the user may be suspended from the service. What appears in the liability agreement that everyone with KTH accounts signs also applies to the use of the KTH data repository. As a user, you are responsible for following the general rules for the use of KTH's system that can be found in [the liability agreement](https://intra.kth.se/en/it/natverk/regler-policys/rules-for-computer-network-and-system-facilities-1.517130) and other relevant guidelines for KTH's operations described below. KTH Data Repository is a service primarily intended for KTH's research activities.

For use within research activities, KTH's [Guidelines for handling research](https://intra.kth.se/en/styrning/styrdokument/regler/forskning-1.661383) data must be followed.

Users are responsible for ensuring that confidential information where there is a risk that KTH or individuals suffer damage from open publication of the information is not made available with public access. [See instructions for information security](https://intra.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.662182.1562824320!/Anvisning_for_informations_och_it-sakerhet.pdf) data must be followed.

For example, you must not make collected personal data or someone else's copyrighted material publicly available if you have not obtained permission from the copyright holder or consent from the person who was included as a research subject in a research study. For more information - see KTH's guideline for intellectual assets. and [KTH guidelines for application of rules on public access to information and secrecy](https://intra.kth.se/en/styrning/styrdokument/regler/dokumenthantering-och-handlingsoffentlighet-1.660522) and [information on personal data processing](https://intra.kth.se/anstallning/anstallningsvillkor/att-vara-statligt-an/behandling-av-person/dataskyddsforordningen-gdpr-1.800623).

If you are unsure whether material collected as raw data in research projects contains confidential information, contact [researchdata@kth.se](mailto:researchdata@kth.se) for advice.

Processing of users' personal data and processing of personal data included in the data that users store in the service

---

When you create a user account for the KTH Data Repository service, KTH processes your personal data. The purpose of KTH's personal data processing for user accounts is to be able to administer accounts and authorize users to access the service and perform operations necessary to maintain the service. You can contact KTH's data protection officer through [dataskyddsombud@kth.se](mailto:dataskyddsombud@kth.se) to close your account and you will then be removed from the user registry.

If you have entered your name and possibly ORCID as author, copyright holder or responsible for data processing in research projects when making a data set available, the name will remain in the system even if you close your account and other personal data processing ceases as it corresponds to the author declaration at publication and that is part of necessary information needed for publication purposes.

KTH is in most cases the personal data controller for personal data included in data processed in KTH's research activities. In cases where another organisation is the data controller, this should be regulated in an agreement with the external party. If an external party uses the KTH Data Repository to make available data where the data files contain personal data, there must be an established agreement between the external party and KTH where KTH is either a personal data processor or where KTH is one of the parties in joint personal data processing that is regulated in the agreement.

Data files containing personal data or other confidential information must only be shared within a limited community, i.e. a group with limited access, where the person responsible for the community is employed at KTH and is responsible for the data files uploaded within the community. This responsibility may be delegated to another person employed at KTH. Please note that the terms of use may change. As a user, you will then receive information about changed conditions. For external users, fees for use may be charged in the event of changes to the terms of use in the future.
