# Sharing a Record in KTH Datarepository

KTH Datarepository facilitates the easy sharing of records with colleagues and collaborators. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of sharing a record with other users.

## Prerequisites

- You should be logged in.
- A record you own that you want to share.

## Steps to Share a Record

1. ### Access your Record

   From your dashboard or records list, locate and click on your record you wish to share.

2. ### Locate the Sharing Option

   Within the record's detailed view, find the 'Share' under edit and new version buttons on the right of the screen.

3. ### Share the Link

   Upon clicking the 'Share' button, a modal should appear "Get a link" providing a direct link to your record. Press "Get link", wait a second, then the link generated will be copied automatically.

> **Note:** There are three types of permissions in the link generated (Can view, Can preview, Can edit):
>
> - **Can view:** Anyone with this link can view all versions of this record & files.
> - **Can preview:** Anyone with this link can view all published and unpublished versions of this record & files.
> - **Can edit:** Anyone with an account and this link can edit all versions of this record & files.

Ensure that the record's permissions allow the shared users to view or edit it as intended. You might need to adjust the record's visibility or access settings accordingly.
4. ### Distribute the Link

   Share the copied link with your colleagues, collaborators, or any intended recipients. They can access the record directly using this link and the permissions you set for the link.
5. ### Link Deletion

   You can delete the link at any time, and those you shared the link with will no longer be able to access the record.
