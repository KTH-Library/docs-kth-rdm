# GitHub Integration

The InvenioRDM GitHub Archiver (IGA) is a tool developed by the California Institute of Technology. It automates the process of archiving GitHub software releases to an InvenioRDM-based repository server. The tool can be run manually from the command line or automatically using GitHub Actions.

IGA is particularly useful for syncing repository status between GitHub and InvenioRDM. It extracts metadata from GitHub releases and repositories, constructs a metadata record in the format required by InvenioRDM, and sends the record along with the GitHub release source archive to the InvenioRDM server.
