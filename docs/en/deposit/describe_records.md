# Describe posts

See the [Create new upload](./create_new_upload.md) for an overview of creating a new upload. This section provides a detailed description of each field available in the deposit form:

- **[Resource types](#resource-types)** — Select the right resource type.
- **[Digital Object Identifier (DOI)](#digital-object-identifier-doi)** — How to reserve a DOI for inclusion in files before publication.
- **Titles** — How to add a main title and additional titles.
- **Publication date** — Learn to use date ranges or imprecise dates.
- **Creators** — Learn how to add creators/authors for your post.
- **Descriptions** — Learn how to add abstracts and notes.
- **Licenses and rights** — Learn to choose a license for your post.
- **Contributors** — Learn to add persons/organisations that do not appear in the citation.

## Resource types

The resource type field is a required field in the deposit form. The resource type is used to describe the nature of the files being shared and is important for the discoverability of your post.

## Selecting a resource type

1. From the resource type field drop-down, select one of the resource types that best describes the files you are sharing.
2. The selected resource type is important for the discoverability of your upload, both for users to find your research output and because various discovery systems only index, for example, publications, datasets, or software from the KTH Data Repository.

## Mixed resource types

You may find that you want to share a digital object that consists of, for example, both data and software, or any other combination of multiple resource types. In these cases, there are two possible solutions:

1. **Choose one type** – Select the resource type that you believe best describes and/or is most significant for the upload. For instance, the main contribution may be the dataset, while the software consists of a couple of processing scripts.
2. **Split the upload** – Divide the upload into multiple posts, one per resource type. Choose this method when both, for example, the dataset and software are significant contributions in themselves.

## Digital Object Identifier (DOI)

A Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is a globally unique persistent identifier for your post. The DOI is important because:

- It provides a permanent link to your upload so readers can always reliably locate your content.
- It is important for discovery systems to attribute citations correctly.
- It enables reliable interlinking of research outputs.
- It makes your research more discoverable by indexing the DOI metadata in a global registry.

By default, the KTH Data Repository registers DOIs for all uploads when they are published. If you need to know the DOI before publication, you can use the method below to reserve a DOI. The reserved DOI can then be included in files (e.g., a text document) before uploading them.

## Reserve a DOI

1. In the **Digital Object Identifier** field, answer **"No"** to the question *"Do you already have a DOI for this upload?"*
2. Click the **Get a DOI now!** button.
3. A DOI will now be reserved for you. You can include this DOI in files before uploading them (e.g., in a text document). You can also remove it by clicking the **X** button next to the DOI.

If you remove the reserved DOI, you can retrieve the same reserved DOI again by clicking the **Get DOI** button. However, if you delete the draft upload, the reserved DOI is lost.

## Use an existing DOI

If you have already shared or uploaded your post to another repository or journal, you may already have a DOI. In this case, you must provide the existing DOI to prevent multiple DOIs being registered for the same content. Note that if you are sharing supplementary data for a journal article, you should **not** use the journal article DOI.

1. In the **Digital Object Identifier** field, answer **"Yes"** to the question *"Do you already have a DOI for this upload?"*
2. Copy and paste (to avoid typos) the existing DOI into the field. The DOI will be validated for conformity, and a given DOI may only be deposited once in the KTH Data Repository (i.e., duplicate detection is in place).
