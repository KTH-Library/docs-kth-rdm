# Describe posts

See the [Create new upload](./create_new_upload.md) for an overview of creating a new upload. This section provides a detailed description of each field available in the deposit form:

- **[Resource types](#resource-types)** — Select the right resource type.
- **Digital Object Identifier (DOI)** — How to reserve a DOI for inclusion in files before publication.
- **Titles** — How to add a main title and additional titles.
- **Publication date** — Learn to use date ranges or imprecise dates.
- **Creators** — Learn how to add creators/authors for your post.
- **Descriptions** — Learn how to add abstracts and notes.
- **Licenses and rights** — Learn to choose a license for your post.
- **Contributors** — Learn to add persons/organisations that do not appear in the citation.

## Resource types

The resource type field is a required field in the deposit form. The resource type is used to describe the nature of the files being shared and is important for the discoverability of your post.

## Selecting a resource type

1. From the resource type field drop-down, select one of the resource types that best describes the files you are sharing.
2. The selected resource type is important for the discoverability of your upload, both for users to find your research output and because various discovery systems only index, for example, publications, datasets, or software from the KTH Data Repository.

## Mixed resource types

You may find that you want to share a digital object that consists of, for example, both data and software, or any other combination of multiple resource types. In these cases, there are two possible solutions:

1. **Choose one type** – Select the resource type that you believe best describes and/or is most significant for the upload. For instance, the main contribution may be the dataset, while the software consists of a couple of processing scripts.
2. **Split the upload** – Divide the upload into multiple posts, one per resource type. Choose this method when both, for example, the dataset and software are significant contributions in themselves.
