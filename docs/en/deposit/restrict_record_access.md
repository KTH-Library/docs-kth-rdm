# Creating a Restricted Record

This service offers functionality to create records with restricted access. This feature allows data curators and administrators to limit the visibility of certain records, making them accessible only to authorized users. In this guide, we'll outline the process to create a restricted record.

A restricted record is a record that contains sensitive or confidential information and is not publicly accessible. Restricted records can be useful in cases where you want to provide access to certain information or resources to only a select group of users or organisations.

## Prerequisites

- It's required to be logged in to submit your record.

## Steps to Create a Restricted Record

1. ### Login to your account

   Navigate to the login page and enter your credentials.

2. ### Start the Record Creation Process

   Navigate to a desired community and click **New upload**.

3. ### Fill Out Record Details

   Complete the form with the necessary details about your record, such as title, authors, and other metadata.

4. ### Set Access Restrictions

   Look for the options on the right side of the deposit page or the section labeled 'Visibility'. Here, you'll be able to:
   - **Set Full record visibility:** Choose 'Restricted' to limit the visibility of the record metadata and files altogether.
   - **Set Files only:** Choose 'Restricted' to limit the visibility of record files only, while the metadata will stay public.

5. ### Submit for Review and Confirm

   After filling out the deposit form, click the 'Submit for review' button. Your restricted record will now be submitted for review by the community curators, and you will be notified when it is accepted by checking your inbox under the "/me/requests" route.
