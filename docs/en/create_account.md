# Create an Account

You can create an account in several ways. If you already have an ORCID, GitHub, or KTH account, we recommend the following options:

## Log in with KTH Account

Use your KTH account to create an account for seamless access.

</figure>

!!! note
    If your screen is too small, you may need to click the hamburger menu in the top right corner to reveal the login button.
