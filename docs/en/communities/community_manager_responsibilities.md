# Terms of Use and Specific Responsibilities for Community Managers

## General Terms

KTH Data Repository (referred to here as KTH.se/namn) is a platform for documenting and sharing data. It serves as a collaborative space where KTH's employees, students, and external collaborators can document, version control, and share data with varying levels of access. All systems and services provided by KTH must be used in compliance with applicable regulations, including guidelines, rules, and laws regarding data stored and shared through KTH.se/namn. Failure to comply with these rules may result in suspension from the platform.

The terms outlined in the liability agreement signed by all KTH account holders also apply to KTH.se/namn. As a user, you must adhere to the general rules for using KTH systems as specified in the [liability agreement](https://intra.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.662185.1715157603!/ansvar_skyldigheter_systemadministrat%C3%B6r.pdf) and other relevant guidelines for KTH’s operations.

KTH.se/namn supports KTH’s core operations, including education, research, administrative, and union activities. Below are additional terms specific to KTH.se/namn.

### Responsibilities of the Community Creator

As a community manager, you are responsible for all data management within your community. Communities on KTH.se/namn are designed to facilitate data sharing in collaboration within KTH’s areas of operation. Communities may only be made public after an appropriate risk assessment (e.g., through a data management plan) and when the content has been deemed suitable for open data sharing. Communities are not intended for personal use.

For more details on research data management, refer to [KTH's Guideline for Research Data Management](https://intra.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.1037530.1714460492!/Riktlinje-om-hantering-av-forskningsdata.pdf).

### Guidance from Research Leaders and Data Protection Officers

As a community manager, it is your responsibility to ensure that data is shared at the correct access level. KTH.se/namn provides various levels of access to suit different data types. For any uncertainties about data confidentiality, consult with your research group leader or KTH’s Data Protection Officer (contact: researchdata@kth.se).

KTH reserves the right to remove any material that violates Swedish archival laws or contains confidential information that could harm KTH or individuals.

### Visibility and Access Levels

Data should not be made public if it might result in:

- Disclosure of public documents covered by secrecy under the Public Access to Information and Secrecy Act (2009:400)
- Disclosure of classified information
- Disclosure of personal data that risks individual privacy
- Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted material

Information that cannot be made public can often be shared with restricted access within a community.

As a community manager, you decide which users have access to restricted data and must only add those who should view or interact with sensitive information.

### Levels of Visibility

For datasets:

- **Public**: Anyone can search for and download files.
- **Restricted (files)**: Only community members can download, but descriptions are public.
- **Restricted (files and descriptions)**: Only community members can view descriptions and download files.

For communities:

- **Public**: Searchable and downloadable by anyone.
- **Restricted**: Only accessible to community members.

KTH administrators can access all data but must adhere to KTH's system administrator responsibilities as outlined in the [responsibility agreement](https://intra.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.662185.1562824393!/ansvar_skyldigheter_systemadministrat%C3%B6r.pdf). KTH follows public access laws, meaning material in KTH.se/namn may be public records, which must be disclosed upon request unless exempt by law.

## Copyright

Respect copyright by only uploading material you own or have permission to use. KTH.se/namn defaults to the CC-BY 4.0 license for datasets, allowing free use with attribution. Other licenses may be selected according to [KTH's guidelines for intellectual assets](https://intra.kth.se/polopoly_fs/1.661400.1562745602!/Riktlinje_om_intellektuella_tillg%C3%A5ngar_skapade_vid_KTH.pdf).

## Processing of Personal Data

When you create an account on KTH.se/namn, KTH processes your personal data. If you terminate your account, your name will remain in the system where required by publication standards. KTH is generally the data controller but may act as a data processor depending on agreements with external collaborators.

## Acceptance of Terms

By acting as a community manager, you confirm that you have read, understood, and accept these responsibilities. Changes to terms may be made, and you will be notified of any updates. External users may incur future fees upon terms changes.
