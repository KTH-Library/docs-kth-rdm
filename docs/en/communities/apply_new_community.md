# Apply for a New Community in the KTH Data Repository

In the KTH Data Repository, a community is a curated space where users can gather, organise, and manage related records under a common topic, event, project, or organisational scope. Communities provide a structured way to organise collections of records, facilitate collaboration, and promote discoverability by grouping similar content together. They can also control access and visibility to align with the needs of specific user groups or privacy requirements. This guide outlines the steps to apply for a new community.

In order to get a community the first step is to familiarize yourself with the [responsibilities associated with managing a community](./community_manager_responsibilities.md). Next, please contact [researchdata@kth.se](mailto:researchdata@kth.se) with a written request for a community.

There are four main types of communities: event, topic, organisation and project. As a rule, the person responsible for the event, project or organisation should be the community owner. If you want to become a community owner please send a request to [researchdata@kth.se](mailto:researchdata@kth.se) and provide the following information in the mail:

- Name
- Department
- What type of community you want to become responsible for.

If you are a PI requesting a project community, please add the title of the project and, if relevant, the name of external funder(s). If there are members of the research group that will be contributing to the community you can provide those names as well. Default storage quota for a project community is 5 Tb of storage.

If you are an event organiser, please add title of the event / conference and dates for the event.

If you want a community for a department or a centra we will contact you for a discussion on what policy and storage quota that is needed for the organisatorial entity first.

In the next step, you will receive an e-mail with a document describing your responsibilities as a community owner. You need to confirm that you accept the responsibilities by replying to the e-mail, and then you will receive a link to your new community that is ready to use.
