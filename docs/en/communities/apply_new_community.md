In the KTH Data Repository, a community is a curated space where users can gather, organize, and manage related records under a common theme, project, or organizational scope. Communities provide a structured way to showcase collections of records, facilitate collaboration, and promote discoverability by grouping similar content together. They can also control access and visibility to align with the needs of specific user groups or privacy requirements. This guide outlines the steps to create a new community.

## Prerequisites

- Admin or community creation privileges.

## Steps to Create a New Community

- **Apply for a Community Creator Role**  
  Ensure you have applied for the community creator role through the application process at [kth.se/rdm-repository](https://kth.se/rdm-repository).

- **Read and Accept Community Manager Responsibilities**  

    !!! Note
        Before proceeding, ensure that you have read and accepted the [responsibilities associated with managing a community](./community_manager_responsibilities.md). As a community manager, you are responsible for the content, membership, and compliance of the community with repository policies.

- **Login to the KTH Data Repository**  
  Navigate to the login page and enter your credentials. Ensure you have the required permissions to create communities.

- **Go to the Communities Section**  
  From the main dashboard, click on the "Communities" tab in the navigation menu.
