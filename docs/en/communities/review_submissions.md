## Review submissions

Any KTH Data Repository user can submit records to your community via two different methods:

- **Submit for review** for unpublished records.
- **Submit to community** for published records.

The following sections explain how you, as a community curator, review these submissions.

## Review policy

Community owners can set the review policy to allow curators, managers, and owners to submit without review.

## Permissions

As a community curator, you can:

- Edit unpublished records before you accept them into your community.
- Edit published records after you accept them into your community.

### Publish on accept

An unpublished record is published when you accept the record into the community.
