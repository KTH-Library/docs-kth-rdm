## About Communities

Communities are shared areas on KTH Data Repository where projects, institutions, domains, and conferences can curate and manage their research outputs.

### About Communities

Your project, institution, department, domain, or conference can collaborate on KTH Data Repository using the communities feature, which serves as a shared area curated and managed by your team.

Each person always logs in to KTH Data Repository using their personal account. Only community creators can create a new community, see [apply to a community](./apply_new_community.md). Once the community is created, you can invite an unlimited number of people to your community. Each person is given a role that grants them different levels of access to the community and its records. A member of the community can hold one of the following roles:

| Roles      | Reader | Curator | Manager | Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| **Can view files in restricted records** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Can accept/decline submissions** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Can edit records metadata** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Can invite members** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Can manage members** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Can modify community settings** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Can delete community** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

Any user on KTH Data Repository can submit records for inclusion in a community. The community curators are responsible for curating the records and ultimately accepting or declining the record into the community.
